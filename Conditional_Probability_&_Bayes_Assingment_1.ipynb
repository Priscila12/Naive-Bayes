    "#Bayes' Theorem \n",
    "\n",
    "It is said that the Reverend Thomas Bayes developed his rule on inverse probability while he was trying to prove the existence of God somewhere around 1740. He came up with a method for calculating the probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred. Starting out with the prior probability (or believe) $P(A)$, when given a likelihood) $P(B\\ |\\ A)$ and evidence $P(B)$ we arrive at the posterior probability $P(A\\ |\\ B)$. Bayes Rule proves to be a powerful tool and is widely used in diverging areas like economics, artificial intelligence, medicine, journalism, military, just to name a few. Most spam filters use Bayes Rule in one way or another. The Bayes' Theorem formula is, posterior = likelihood times prior, over evidence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A\\ |\\ B)=\\frac{P(B\\ |\\ A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The practical power of Bayes Rule is that we often can't find the posterior directly, yet we do know the likelihood of the test and $P(A)$."
